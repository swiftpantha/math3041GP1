What was the screenshot about? That was just applying an susceptible infection susceptible model to this not sure if it’s right at all! 

Tristan- Just putting in a basic write up, we can change it I just want to get something down

Moss- Ah fair call just wanted to let you know that the model there was more of an interest thing then anything I’m sure about!

Tristan- Yeah I know, and it won’t be our final single gene model I am sure by a long way. Just setting up the system really so we have somewhere from where to place our images later. Also this way we can just update the image there as we go e.c.t


Cool Cool Cool top effort man keen to have a look this evening! :)

This dropbox changing so fast can’t even keep track hahaha
